# SNAKE!

HSGC, Intro to Computer Science — September 19, 2014 — Start with [**Snake** SNAP project](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=loganmoseley&ProjectName=snake_init)

## Abstract

Create your own _Snake_-style game in SNAP.

First appearing in arcades in the 70s, Snake was a simple idea that has turned into nearly 40 years of fun. This awesome game has been ported or remade for Atari, Commodore, Microsoft DOS, Windows, various phones, on tons of websites, and even Gmail. The 1997 Nokia phone version of Snake was one of just a few games considered for MoMA's video game exhibit. [Wikipedia][1]

## Specifications

1. The game starts when the **green flag** is pressed.
2. The snake's head (the sprite) starts at the center of the screen and **moves** to the right.
3. **Pressing** the "left" or "right" arrow key turns the snake 90° left or right.
4. The snake leaves behind a **green pen trail** as it moves.
5. The game is over when the snake **touches the edge** of the stage or **touches its tail**. (The snake should stop.)

[**Snake** SNAP project](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=loganmoseley&ProjectName=snake_init) will get you started.

Don't forget your resetting blocks.

## Extra Credit

Congratulations, you've recreated the classic Snake game! Add in some DLC for your fans.

a. **Scoring** Award 1 point for every 1 distance moved.

b. **Two Player** Play the game with two snakes. The last player standing wins.
c. **Teleport Walls** Move the snake from one side to the other when it goes off the screen. This overrides the _game over_ specification (#4).
