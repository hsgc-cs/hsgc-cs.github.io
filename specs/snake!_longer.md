# SNAKE!

HSGC, Intro to Computer Science

September 19, 2014

Start with [**Snake** SNAP project](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=loganmoseley&ProjectName=snake_init)

## Abstract

Create your own _Snake_-style game in SNAP.

First appearing in arcades in the 70s, Snake was a simple idea that has turned into nearly 40 years of fun. This awesome game has been ported or remade for Atari, Commodore, Microsoft DOS, Windows, various phones, on tons of websites, and even Gmail. The 1997 Nokia phone version of Snake was one of just a few games considered for MoMA's video game exhibit. [Wikipedia][1]

## Specifications

1. The snake's head (the sprite) starts at the center of the screen. It begins moving when the green flag is pressed. It doesn't stop moving until the game is over.
2. Pressing the "left" or "right" arrow key turns the snake 90Â° left or right.
3. The snake leaves behind a trail as it moves. This is its tail so it's probably the same color as the head! (Hint: This might involve the pen tool.)
4. The game is over when the snake hits the edge of the stage or its own tail.
    * We've touched on this block this a little bit. You'll find it in the starting project.

To get going, start with the shared [**Snake** SNAP project](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=loganmoseley&ProjectName=snake_init).

Don't forget your resetting blocks.

## Extra Credit

Congratulations, you've recreated the classic Snake game! Add in some DLC for your fans.

a. **Scoring** Award 1 point for every 1 distance moved.
    * Try to get the highest score in the class. Can you beat 5000? 9000?
b. **Two Player** Play the game with two snakes. The last player standing wins.
c. **Teleport Walls** Move the snake from one side to the other when it goes off the screen. This overrides the _game over_ specification (#4).
