HSGC, Intro to Computer Science

September 19, 2014

Start with [**Snake** SNAP project](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=loganmoseley&ProjectName=snake_init)

## Assignment

Create your own _Snake_-style game in SNAP.

1. The snake's head (the sprite) starts at the center of the screen. It begins moving when the green flag is pressed. It doesn't stop moving until the game is over.
2. Pressing the "left" or "right" arrow key turns the snake 90Â° left or right.
3. The snake leaves behind a green pen trail as it moves.
4. The game is over when the snake hits the edge of the stage or its own tail.

## Extra Credit

a. **Scoring** Award 1 point for every 1 distance moved. Can you beat 5000? 9000?
b. **Two Player** Play the game with two snakes. The last player standing wins.
c. **Teleport Walls** Move the snake from one side to the other when it goes off the screen.
