# SNAKE!

HSGC, Intro to Computer Science

September 19, 2014

Start with [**Snake** SNAP project](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=loganmoseley&ProjectName=snake_init)

## Assignment

Create your own _Snake_-style game in SNAP.

1. The game starts when the **green flag** is pressed.
2. The snake's head (the sprite) starts at the center of the screen and **moves** to the right.
3. **Pressing** the "left" or "right" arrow key turns the snake 90Â° left or right.
4. The snake leaves behind a **green pen trail** as it moves.
5. The game is over when the snake **touches the edge** of the stage or **touches its tail**. (The snake should stop.)

## Extra Credit

a. **Scoring** Award 1 point for every 1 distance moved. Can you beat 5000? 9000?
b. **Two Player** Play the game with two snakes. The last player standing wins.
c. **Teleport Walls** Move the snake from one side to the other when it goes off the screen.
